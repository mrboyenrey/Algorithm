# Algorithm Practice

This folder contains various algorithm problems and their solutions implemented in PHP. It serves as a practice ground for improving problem-solving skills and understanding algorithmic concepts.

## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to:
- Practice solving algorithmic problems.
- Learn and apply PHP programming concepts.
- Experiment with different approaches to problem-solving.

## Current Problems
### 1. MatchNumber Algorithm
- **Description**: Compares two numbers entered by the user and performs specific actions based on the comparison.
- **File**: `MatchNumber.php`
- **Features**:
  - Accepts two numeric inputs via an HTML form.
  - Displays the sum and triple of the sum if the numbers are equal.
  - Displays "Not Matched" if the numbers are not equal.
  - Validates numeric inputs.

## How to Use
1. Open the desired PHP file in a web server environment (e.g., Laragon, XAMPP).
2. Follow the instructions provided in the file or its associated documentation.
3. Modify the code or add new problems to enhance your learning.

## Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or higher.
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

## Notes
- This folder is for educational purposes and personal practice.
- Feel free to add more algorithm problems and solutions to expand the collection.
